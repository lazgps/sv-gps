Inman.com is reporting that across the country [rent prices are growing faster than pre-pandemic prices](https://www.inman.com/2021/01/19/rent-prices-growing-faster-than-pre-pandemic-corelogic/?utm_content=buffer92132&distinct_id=rkjtVkpx8&user_email=tere%40gps-realestate.com). This is really good news for property investment, while at the same time, as reported by the Orlando Sentinel, [available properties in Metro Orlando have dropped to their lowest levels in 15 years, while prices have rose 10%](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/real-estate/os-prem-bz-real-estate-2020-recap-20210121-5n5ad4wh75brrklpk6d6xkk4wy-story.html).
