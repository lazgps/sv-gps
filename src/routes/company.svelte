              <h3 class="text-gray-500 mb-3">Principal Broker</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">Teresa Alvarez is a native Floridian born in Miami to Cuban parents.  She studied Political Science and International Relations at FIU and graduated with a double BA.  
                Having started her real estate career in 2005, Teresa sold multiple billions of dollars in real estate during the condo conversion era in the mid 2000s.  
                Shortly thereafter, her focus shifted to general sales and property management.  
                In 2009, Teresa moved to Central Florida and specialized in the Central Florida real estate market.  
                Founding GPS Realty and Property Management in 2015, Teresa is passionate about managing rental properties for absentee owners as if they were her own.  
                As an active investor herself, she understands the pain points that an absentee owner has and is resolved to help maximize their profits.  
                She enjoys spending time with her family and friends, camping with her significant other of 10 years, Todd, and their little yorkie, Daisy.  
                Reading, self-improvement, networking, and travel are her favorite pastimes. </p>

              <p class="mb-4">Doraliz Fernandez was born in Dominican Republic but raised most of her life in central florida. Coming from a very close family, 
                she has learned to value relations both personal and professionally. Her value for family life has helped her develop traits and qualities such as flexibility, 
                compassion, and perseverance which projects in every aspect of her work life. In 2015 she was offered the opportunity to shift occupations from hospitality to property management, 
                working directly with HOA's. The knowledge and years of experience she was able to gain during this time gave her a smooth transition to Real Estate, once she joined the GPS Realty and Property Management family in 2018. 
                During her personal time, Doraliz enjoys spending time with her husband, and their little girl GIanna. When she is not occupied at home, 
                you can find her outdoors searching for the next adventure!</p>
